## Hi there 👋

Nice to e-meet you, I'm Alexandra and I'm Front-end developer.

Since beginning my journey as a Front-end developer, I've done remote work for different companies and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.


Apart from my ❤️ to coding, I also:

- 🏃 can't leave without a daily dosis of physical activity and a couple of hours of training in gym
- 💃 dance bachata and salsa
- 🙌🏻 practice a meditation to concentrate and get my head straight 
- 🧠 invest my time in self-development and personal growth by getting knowledge in different areas. Psychology, Geography and Economy are the the main pillars I'm focused right now.

I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas. 
Find out more about me & feel free to connect with me via [e-mail](alexkuchynsk@gmail.com) or [Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-kuchynskaya/).
